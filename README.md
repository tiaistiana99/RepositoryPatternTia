Repository Pattern
---
This is a sample app that is developed to showcase MVVM architecture for Android with
Repository pattern and Offline-First strategy with Single Source of Truth.

**NOTE** It is a relatively more complex and in progress architecture example so if you are not familiar
with [Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/arch), you are highly recommended to check other examples
in their repository first.

Introduction

* Android Framework with Kotlin
* Repository pattern with offline-first strategy
* MVVM architectural pattern
* Android Architecture Components
